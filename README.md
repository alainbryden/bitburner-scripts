# Disclaimer

This is my own repository of scripts for playing Bitburner.
I often go to some lengths to make them generic and customizable, but am by no means providing these scripts as a "service" to the bitburner community.
It's meant as an easy way for me to share code with friends, and track changes and bugs in my scripts.

- If you wish to use my scripts or copy from them, feel free!
- If you think you found a bug in them and want to let me know, awesome!
- Please don't be insulted if you make a feature request, bug report, or pull request that I decline to act on.
While I do like my work to be helpful to others and re-used, I am only willing to put so much effort into customizing it to others' specific needs or whims.
You should fork the code, and start tweaking it the way you want it to behave. That's more in the spirit of the game!

Hit up the Bitburner Discord with any questions: https://discord.gg/Wjrs92b3
Many helpful folks in there are familiar with my scripts or ones similar to them and can address your questions and concerns far quicker than I can.
